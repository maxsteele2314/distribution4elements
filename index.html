     <h2>
         Distribution
     </h2>
 <p>
      There is no such thing as a perfect distribution but in most cases normal disribution carries these specific traits:
 </p>
 <ol>
    <li>Its mean, median and mode are the same.</li>
    <li>The distribution is symmetrical:50% below the mean and 50% below </li>
    <li>We know what percentage of scores lay in between certain ranges.</li>   <li>Arithmetic can be completed with these given figures.</li>
 </ol>
     <p>
     In any case in which we can assume that our data is normally distributed we can estimate the probabilty of any case or score with reasonable accuracy.
     </p>
     <h4>
      Level
     </h4>
     
     <p>
     The level caputures the measures of central tendency. It takes the given mean, median and mode to give an overlaying look of the data set and at which "level" the graph can be assumed to be at.
     </p>
     
     <h4>
      Spread
     </h4>
     
     <p>
     Used to describe the variability in a sample set. It is usually used alomg with measures such as the mean or median to provide an overall description of a set of data.
     </p>
     
     <h4>
     Shape
     </h4>
     
     <p>
     Describes the diffrent types of graphs we will see. There are four diffrent ways to describe a graphs shape:
     </p>
     <ol>
         <li>Symmetric: left and right sides of the graph are mirror images</li>
         <li>How many peaks it has</li>
         <li>If it is off to the left or right</li>
         <li>Whether it is a uniform grpah</li>
     </ol>
     
     <h4>
     Outliers
     </h4>
     
     <p>
     Outliers are elements of our models that don't fit the density curve as expected. They typically lie far from the median and mode giving them the name outliers. Delving into these exceptions involves transforming our data such that it leaves out this given value and keeps it astray from our graphs and central tendency. Otherwise it might scew out numbers leading to untruthful information.
